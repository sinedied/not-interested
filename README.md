Tired of receiving the same old generic "opportunities" templates from recruiters? Here are some generic templates you can use to answer.

## Reply template to a too generic job proposal

Hello dear recruiter, I'm sorry to tell you that I'm not interested by your offer and won't ever be, unless you can afford for a bit of cutomization in your messages. Actually I didn't found any informations in your message, apart from my name or any easily scriptable information (please remember that I'm a developer). This make me feel to be the target of a massive developer fishing attempt and to be honest I dislike it. Also, as a good developer I value saving time with my daily routine, so like you I'm using a template for to reply. This template comes from [sinedied/not-interested](https://github.com/sinedied/not-interested).

If you ever happen to take the time to write a more customized and human message, I would be pleased to make a human written answer in my turn.

Please accept my best regards.
